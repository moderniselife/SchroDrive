### Version [0.1.20] - 2025-11-10 🚀

### Added ✨
- Prowlarr client tuning via environment:
  - `PROWLARR_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 45000, clamped 5s–120s)
  - `PROWLARR_INDEXER_IDS` (comma-separated IDs) to limit queried indexers
  - `PROWLARR_SEARCH_LIMIT` to cap results
- Magnet/HTTP(S) resolver:
  - HEAD-first, multi-hop (up to `PROWLARR_REDIRECT_MAX_HOPS`) resolution of Prowlarr download URLs that redirect to `magnet:` or `.torrent`
  - New env: `PROWLARR_REDIRECT_MAX_HOPS` (default 5)
- Query sanitation and fallbacks:
  - Strip `TMDB####` tokens from search queries before calling Prowlarr
  - Retry without the year when zero results are returned
  - Retry without categories when still zero results
- Send `type=search` to `/api/v1/search`
- Overseerr auth: support either `X-Api-Key` or `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### Changed 🔄
- Improved request/diagnostic logging for Prowlarr (timeouts, params, fallbacks) and Overseerr
- Default Prowlarr client timeout increased to 45s (configurable)
- Overseerr poller now attempts magnet resolution from HTTP/HTTPS links when a direct magnet is not provided

### Fixed 🐛
- 401 Unauthorized on Prowlarr search by including `X-Api-Key` header in `/api/v1/search`
- 401 Unauthorized on Overseerr API calls by honoring configured `X-Api-Key` or `Authorization: Bearer` headers
